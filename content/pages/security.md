summary: Dead activists needed better security. Embrace strong security practices, or die. Literally. They'll find you, and kill you.
status: draft

There's a myth that says gaining knowledge must be a struggle.  

This myth is a lie.  

Gaining knowledge is as simple as listening.
The quieter you are, the more you can hear.

Operational Security, or `opsec`, is the difference between a successful and an unsuccessful team.
When your enemy can access your communications, it doesn't matter how good your plan was.

There are a lot of good tools out there.
Some of them are better than others.

But they are just tools, and they *cannot* replace a careful mindset.
Filter what you are told. Ask questions and determine truth.

Plans built on false or partial information, will fail.
Plans that do not adapt, will fail.
Plans that are leaked, will fail.

If you want to be an activist, start by securing your things, your data, and your thoughts.


Now.  
Let's talk about some good tools.

# Mozilla Thunderbird
Email client.  
(_Completely_ insecure without additional steps.)

## [Enigmail](https://www.enigmail.net/)
Encrypt your email.

Full stop.
If you can't encrypt it, don't send it.

Unencrypted emails, in the long term, destroy hope of progress and change, and result in people getting harassed, deported, and killed.  

Literally.

'nuff said.

### Mac Users
GPG Keychain is your friend.  
@todo - add links to instructions.  

# Signal
SMS and MMS messages are cleartext.  
Signal adds a layer of encryption, and does an excellent job of stripping metadata from your conversations.  

Signal uniquely identifies you as you to the person on the other end of the conversation.  
Text, audio, and video communication happens in realtime with rock solid encryption.  

## Protect your fellow activists. Switch to Signal.
Remember, **metadata kills activists**.  

# Discord
Encrypted, free voice chat.  
Clients for most platforms.  
It's not perfect, but it's what we've got for now.  

The ability to create small communities, or teams, inside their hosted environment is quite well fleshed out.

# Keybase
Prove your identity.
